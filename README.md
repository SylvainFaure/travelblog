# Travelblog  

This project is not in production yet (it will be soon thanks to Heroku), but for the moment you will find:   
- `server` : a small server written in NodeJS / ExpressJS  
- `public` : a minimal frontend written in AngularJS (for the moment)  
- `admin` : a classical (minimal although) blog interface, with authentication and full of CRUD, written in AngularJS
