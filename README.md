# Travelblog  

This project is in production: http://admin.cartedevoyages.com
Though it's already possible to ask permissions to enter in the admin Ã¨art as a `visitor`, the requests will not be accepted before few weeks.

This project is composed in:

- `admin` : a classical (minimal although) blog interface, with authentication and full of CRUD, written in AngularJS (1.7.2)
- `server` : a small server written in NodeJS / ExpressJS  

This project has a `public` part, a minimal frontend written in Nuxt. This public part has been moved to a separate repository and will be soon accessible in production at http://www.cartedevoyages.com
